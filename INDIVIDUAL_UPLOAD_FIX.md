# Individual Dashboard Upload Documents Fix

## âœ… Issue Fixed:

**Problem**: Individual users couldn't upload documents because the backend required a `recipientEmail` field, but individuals should be able to upload documents for themselves.

## ðŸ”§ Changes Made:

### 1. Backend Controller Fix
**File**: `backend/src/controllers/documentController.js`
- Modified upload logic to allow individuals to upload for themselves
- If user role is 'individual' and no recipientEmail provided, user becomes the recipient
- Issuers still need to specify recipient email

### 2. Frontend Upload Component Fix  
**File**: `frontend/src/components/DocumentUpload.js`
- Added logic to check current user role
- Only sends recipientEmail if user is not an individual
- Individuals can now upload without specifying recipient

### 3. Backend Route Validation Fix
**File**: `backend/src/routes/documents.js`
- Made `recipientEmail` optional in validation
- Still validates email format when provided

## âœ… How It Works Now:

### For Individual Users:
1. Login as individual (individual@demo.com / demo123)
2. Go to Individual Dashboard â†’ Upload Documents tab
3. Select files and upload
4. No need to specify recipient email
5. Documents are automatically assigned to the individual user

### For Issuer Users:
1. Login as issuer (issuer@demo.com / demo123)  
2. Upload documents
3. Must specify recipient email
4. Documents are assigned to the specified recipient

## ðŸŽ¯ Test Steps:

1. **Login as Individual**:
   - Email: individual@demo.com
   - Password: demo123

2. **Navigate to Upload**:
   - Go to Individual Dashboard
   - Click "Upload Documents" tab

3. **Upload Document**:
   - Select any file (JPG, PNG, PDF)
   - Click "Upload All"
   - Should work without errors

4. **Verify Upload**:
   - Check "My Documents" tab
   - Should see uploaded document

## âœ… Expected Results:

- âœ… Individual users can upload documents for themselves
- âœ… No recipient email required for individuals  
- âœ… Upload button works in Individual Dashboard
- âœ… Documents appear in "My Documents" section
- âœ… Issuers still work as before (need recipient email)

The Individual Dashboard upload documents tab should now work perfectly!
